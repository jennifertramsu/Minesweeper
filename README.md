# Minesweeper
<p> A Minesweeper game built in Java that I wasn't actually supposed to make for a COMP 250 presentation, but decided to make anyway because I can't create UML diagrams without actually making the build myself. </p>

<p> Incomplete, because recursive functions are hard. </p>

## To-Do:
<ul>
  <li> Flagging, to make gameplay more bearable </li>
  <li> How to?? Deal with corners when uncovering cells </li>
</ul>
